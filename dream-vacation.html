<p> I love vacations! <br></br>
I would love to take a couple of years to explore the world. <br></br>
(provided that finances are not an obstacle)<br></br>
As long as I don't have to worry about a job/paycheck, <br></br>
I'd take all the time I can visiting small towns and villages and <br></br>
truly immersing myself in a variety of cultures.</p>
